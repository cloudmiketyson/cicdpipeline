"# Building a CI/CD Pipeline for a Retail Company" 

We need to develop a CI/CD pipeline to automate the software development, testing, packaging, and deployment, reducing the time to market the app and ensuring good quality service is experienced by end users. In this project, we need to:

push the code to our GitHub repository
create a continuous integration pipeline using Jenkins to compile, test, and package the code present in GitHub.
Write Dockerfile to push the war file to the Tomcat server
Integrate Docker with Ansible and write the playbook
Deploy artifacts to the Kubernetes cluster
Monitor resources using Grafana.
